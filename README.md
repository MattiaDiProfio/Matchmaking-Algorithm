# SkillPilot - A candidate-to-job recommender system

## Project Overview 
The aim of this project is to explore a range of possible solutions capable of accurately matching candidates suitable for a particular job advertisement. I will proceed by conducting some exploratory data analysis on the (randomly generated) datasets, to then proceed with the implementation of common matchmaking algorithms as well as machine learning regression and classification techniques, and to conclude I will analyse the performance of each approach to select a suitable option to carry out the pairing procedure.
The approaches considered for this project are the Gale-Shapley Algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear Support Vectore Machines, the LambdaMART Algorithm, the Expectation Maximization Algorithm and finally Random Forests.

## Running the Project 
To run the project on your machine, simply clone this repository and ensure that you have conda installed. Open the notebook in an editor of your choice and press the 'Run All' button to execute the entire notebook. A quick **heads-up**, when running the "naive" version of the Gale-Shapley algorithm the notebook will take a couple of minutes since sets of up to 1000 candidates are going through the matching process, 
also in the **Linear SVMs** section, the 3D scatterplot is not displayed if viewing the notebook on GitHub, so I highly recommend following the instructions in this section to apprieciate this project to its fullest.
